## WORK EXPERIENCE

### JD Internship	Dec 2018 - Feb 2019

Solution Engineer	Beijing

Using the data collected by the JD to build a model that explains a social phenomenon called spending power downgrade. Using the model to determine the population in a specific area (Tianjin City) is intending to buy a higher-priced product or a lower-priced product compared with previous. Also, demonstrate the model and result to Tianjin City Tax Authority.

## EXPERIENCE

Project: 

1. Took part in building chatbot via AWS (Alexa: User Voice Interface, Lambda, and EC2) which is the front end. Used Python (flask) as back-end. The algorithm was mainly about RNN. In this capstone project, I got HD. (Core is Natural Language Processing: Intent Classification, Sentiment Analysis, Summarizer)

2. Implemented tradition machine learning algorithms (including SVM, Logistic Regression, PCA, KNN, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes and None-Negative Matrix factorization ) and 3 layers Neural Network from scratch using Python. The accuracy is almost similar to famous machine learning libraries. Understood which algorithm should be used for different characterized data (Core is picture classification and reconstruction).

3. Used Keras framework (One high-level API of Tensorflow) to do 20 classes classification. Suffered the overfitting problem then tried data augmentation to solve the problem and achieved good performance.

4. Analyzed the Youtube Video preference of different countries via Cloud Computing (Iaas provided by USYD). Used both map-reduce(Hadoop) and Spark to solve this problem using Python. And maximized parallelism of the cluster (parallelism degree equals to cluster core numbers)

5. Developed SMS Child Care app. Used SMS to control ringing (Find the phone), getting the location (Latitude and Longitude are useful when the parent cannot find the child) of the phone and taking photos (Circumstance detection of a missed child). The front end is developed by JAVA via Android Studio, the backend used JAVA as well.

6. Grasp classic Machine Learning and traditional Deep Learning algorithms from a mathematic perspective. Used C# to develop Snake and Tetris games which are two classic starting points of C#.
